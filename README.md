# gravitational-pressure-model
This paper presents a modified gravitational model including internal pressures (hydrostatic, rotational, radiative) affecting gravitational acceleration. It explains differences in gravity on planets, stars, and galaxies, offering insights into dark matter effects and improving astrophysical models.
